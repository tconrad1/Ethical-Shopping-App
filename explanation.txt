this is to test if I can push using my IDE and github desktop :)
jan 8th
react native and dependencies added versions for tom's machine   npm: '8.15.0', node v16.17.0,  react "^18.2.0",
we are using node v20.11.0, java 18.0.2+9-61, gradle 8.5  as of jan 14th 
rough code currently broken as a result of the different enviroment, but the emulator does work


usefull cmd line stuff 
react-native start
npx react-native doctor 


**tsconfig.json changes**
theres a line commented out that broke my version but might work
work on others, just uncomment that line and comment out the other one
if thats the case. 
i dont want to break the configs for anyone if it works with the other line lol
